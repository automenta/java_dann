/**
 * <B>ProjectTriangulate</B> takes each new point and determines which two
 * points in the current data set are closest to it. Then, if possible, it will
 * place the projected image of the new point so that its distance from the
 * projected image of its two nearest neighbors is the same as it was in the
 * high dimensional space. When it is not possible to project the point such
 * that its distance to its two nearest neighbors is preserved, then the
 * projected image of the new point will be placed on a line connecting the
 * projected image of its two nearest neighbors. In this case the position of
 * the projected image of the new point on this line is determined by the
 * relative sizes of the distances between the new point and its two nearest
 * neighbors in the current data set.
